## Introduction

The [CDF Events Special Interest Group](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-events) is the home of a very important piece of work to enable Continuous Delivery tooling from numerous vendors to talk together as part of an extended delivery environment.

[CDEvents](https://cdevents.dev) formalises a vocabulary for passing events between CI/CD systems (and other related components) in order to support the best practice of delivering Product to Customers, not code to production.
