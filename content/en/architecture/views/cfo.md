## Viewpoint
The CFO is responsible for all of the financial structure of the organization, and for ensuring compliance with applicable financial legislation.

## View
As CFO, I need to ensure that money is being used efficiently to further the goals of the business. I need to collect regular evidence that we are not spending excessively and I need to be comfortable that we are not incurring significant financial risk.
