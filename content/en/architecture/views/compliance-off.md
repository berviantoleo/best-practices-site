---
## Viewpoint
A Compliance Officer is responsible for reviewing policies and procedures to ensure that the organization meets regulatory requirements. They carry out compliance audits and facilitate the remediation of any issues uncovered.

## View
As a Compliance Officer, I need visibility of all policies, processes and procedures. I must be able to audit all regulated activities.

## Value Add from Continuous Delivery

- Existence of automated processes for release of assets to production
- Existence of audit trails for change and release of assets
- Existence of governance processes for regulated activities
