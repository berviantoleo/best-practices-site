## Viewpoint
The Marketing Director is responsible for the overall marketing strategy for all product lines. They span multiple products and are concerned with the alignment of market positioning, messaging and go-to-market plans across all products. They set the market differentiation approach for the business and ensure alignment between marketing activities and sales channels.

## View
As Marketing Director, I want to be able to ensure that our go-to-market plans are practical and achievable. I want to be comfortable that all our product lines fit with a consistent marketing strategy, providing a coherent set of offerings to the market and offering many opportunities for up-selling and cross-selling. I need to have good data about our customers that I can analyze across products in a reliable way that gives me useful information.
