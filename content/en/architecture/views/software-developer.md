## Viewpoint
Software Developer roles typically span a wide range of engineering specialties. Generically, a Software Developer is concerned with transforming specific user stories into deployable assets using conventional (procedural or declarative) software techniques.

## View
As a Software Developer, I want to be able to put my feature into production so that I can complete this User Story in the current sprint. I want my code to meet the acceptance tests so that I can be confident that it does what is required of it. I want to minimize the amount of complexity inherent in my code so that I can ensure that it is reliable and maintainable.
