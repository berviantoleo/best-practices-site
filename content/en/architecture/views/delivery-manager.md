## View
As a Delivery Manager, I want to be able to optimize my resource usage and delivery time, so that I can meet my Objectives and Key Results. I want to be sure that business process is supporting my team and not getting in the way of them delivering product to customers. I want knowledge to scale easily across all my teams so I can grow as fast as the business needs for the product to attain market leadership. I want a clear picture of the state of my product at any moment in time, so I can manage the delivery effectively.
