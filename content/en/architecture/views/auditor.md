     "The Internal Auditor is responsible for verifying the effectiveness of governance controls"
---
## Viewpoint
An Internal Auditor is typically responsible for testing internal governance controls or investigating potential fraud or other compliance violation.

## View
As an Auditor, I want to be able to validate the operation of governance controls. I need to be able to review business processes. I need to evaluate risk management procedures. I need to ensure that we are compliant with all legal and regulatory requirements.

## Value Add from Continuous Delivery

- Existence of automated processes for release of assets to production
- Existence of audit trails for change and release of assets
- Existence of governance processes for testing delivery against non-technical concerns
