     "The Technical Design Authority is responsible for the architecture of all products within the company"
---
## Viewpoint
The Technical Design Authority is responsible for the architecture of all products within the company. The TDA is typically a jointly held role comprised of a number of architects who are responsible for ensuring that non-functional concerns such as safety, privacy and scalability are being considered as part of engineering deliveries, and that economies of scale are accessible to the business through the efficient re-use of technologies, services and patterns, across products. This architecture team is often responsible for translating between business and engineering domains and liaises between product and enterprise governance teams.

## View
As Technical Design Authority, we want to have a consistent suite of technologies across the enterprise continuum, so that we can have consistent processes and minimize cost of ownership. We want to be able to easily review architectural designs to ensure that non-functional requirements are being considered appropriately. We need to be able to check that engineering deliveries are in compliance with the architecture requirements.

## Value Add from Continuous Delivery

- Being able to ensure that designs include all functional and non-functional requirements
- Being able to validate that releases meet functional and non-functional requirements
- Simplifying the process of re-use for components and services
- Being able to decouple dependencies whilst increasing re-use
- Being able to provide automated audit trails to enterprise governance teams
