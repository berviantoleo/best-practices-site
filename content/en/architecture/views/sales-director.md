## Viewpoint
The Sales Director defines and executes the sales strategy for the organization, setting the direction for various sales teams across all sales channels.

## View
As a Sales Director, I need to be able to help customers understand the value of the product that we make. I need to be able to ensure an ongoing pipeline of new sales prospects and to maintain good customer retention, minimizing the cost of acquisition and retention. I am keen for us to have products that are so compelling that our customers help to sell them to others because they like them so much. 

I need the customer to understand that we understand their problems and have good solutions to mitigate the risks associated. 

I need to understand when something that we are working on will be available to customers, so that I can be selling this in a timely manner. I need to be able to resolve unanticipated customer problems rapidly and effectively.

## Value Add from Continuous Delivery

- Customer-driven product creation
- The ability to discover good products, with the customer
