     "The CISO is responsible for the organization's security"
---
## Viewpoint
The CISO is responsible for ensuring that the organization and its customers' data remain secure, and that the organization remains compliant with applicable security legislation.

## View
As CISO, I need to be able to ensure that everything that we produce, conforms to our security policy. I need to maintain a culture of personal accountability for security, across the organization. I must be sure that we have the ability to recover rapidly from a disaster scenario such as the loss of a data center. I need to be informed immediately of any intrusions into our systems and must be able to implement an effective incident response in a timely manner. I need the ability to maintain audit trails of all activity across sensitive areas of the system and to be able to preserve forensic records to support potential legal action.

## Value Add from Continuous Delivery

- Ability to shift-left on security, embedding security concerns into design, implementation and testing phases
- Ability to automate security compliance testing and apply it to every build
- Ability to react to Zero Day issues and release patches in hours
- Ability to monitor asset security quality on an ongoing basis
- Ability to apply security policy to all build and release activities consistently
- Ability to audit and monitor all release activity
- Leverage the automated CI/CD process to rebuild rapidly following a disaster
